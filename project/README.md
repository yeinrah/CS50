# CS50 FinalProject - Korea Library Guide

Project Title : Korea Library Guide

Video Description Link : https://youtu.be/b7IeC34z158
- In the video, dropdown menus are supposed to look just as it is, but for some unknown reason, it is not showing properly. I apologize for the inconvenience.

<Korea Library Guide> is a dynamic web index for the library in South Korea nationwide. The data is from [공공 데이터 포털](https://www.data.go.kr/index.do), which is a government-run web site that provides various datas about South Korea. I categorized the data by administrative districts which makes the user easier to find the libraries closer to their place.

At the index page, there are 17 grids that links to each of the categories, which is regions in Korea. After selecting one of them, there is a dropdown menu which is dynamically generated by the region the user has selected previously. If the user chooses one of the dropdown menu, which are administrative districts in particular region, libraries in that particular administrative district comes out as a result table.

There are 6 columns in the result table, which is name of the library, address, closed day, number of books you can borrow, days you can borrow, and the library’s website link, respectively.

Basic structures of the app.py code and the htmls are pretty much repeated, since every region page serves almost the same function. I tried to reduce these redundancies, but it was beyond my current ability. I wish to do better in the future, not making this kind of redundancies any more.

I used Python, Flask, HTML, CSS with no other libraries and CS50 IDE to develop this website.

<전국 도서관 안내>는 전국의 도서관 정보를 한번에 볼 수 있는 웹사이트입니다. 전국 도서관 데이터는 [공공 데이터 포털](https://www.data.go.kr/index.do)에서 제공받았습니다.

Python, Flask, HTML, 순수 CSS, CS50 IDE를 사용하여 개발되었습니다.
